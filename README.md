## Usage

The application is fairly straightforward. You are greeted with a splash screen, which then leads you into the note taker. You must enter a `title` and enter `text` into the body of the note. A `save` icon will appear in the upper right corner. Click on it and your note will be saved to the left side-bar. You can save multiple notes, which the application will retain. Selecting a created note, will present the data in the viewing area. If you wish to enter a new note, simply select the `pencil` icon in the upper right corner. If you wish to delete and entry, you simply click on the small `garbage can` icon next to the enrty, in the left side-bar.
